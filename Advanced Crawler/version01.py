"""
Summary:
--------
This script uses Playwright's APIRequestContext to fetch JSON data for a product from the Adidas API.
It avoids HTTP/2 protocol errors by using direct request context instead of navigating a browser page.

Version:
--------
Advanced Crawler Version 01 for Master's Thesis demonstration.

Note:
-----
- This is the introductory version focusing on simple API retrieval without browser automation.
- Later versions will build on this by adding proxy support and possibly CAPTCHA solving.

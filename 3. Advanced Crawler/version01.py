"""
Summary:
--------
This script uses Playwright's APIRequestContext to fetch JSON data for a product from the Adidas API.
It avoids HTTP/2 protocol errors by using direct request context instead of navigating a browser page.

Version:
--------
Advanced Crawler Version 01 for Master's Thesis demonstration.

Note:
-----
- This is the introductory version focusing on simple API retrieval without browser automation.
- Later versions will build on this by adding proxy support and possibly CAPTCHA solving.

Technical Architecture:
---------------------
1. Setup Playwright synchronous context
2. Create API request context
3. Send GET request to Adidas product API
4. Process and display JSON response
5. Clean up resources

Benefits:
--------
- Lighter weight than full browser automation
- Avoids HTTP/2 protocol complexities
- Direct JSON access without HTML parsing
- More efficient for batch processing

    Fetches product data from the Adidas API for a specific product ID.
    
    This function:
    1. Establishes a connection to the Adidas product API
    2. Retrieves raw JSON data for the specified product
    3. Processes and displays the complete product information
    
    No parameters are required as the product ID is hardcoded for demonstration.
    
    Returns:
        None - Results are printed to console

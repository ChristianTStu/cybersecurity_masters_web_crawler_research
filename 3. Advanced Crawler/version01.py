Master's Thesis - Web Scraping Implementation: Advanced Crawler - Version 1 (Playwright API Direct)

This script demonstrates a sophisticated approach to web scraping using Playwright's
APIRequestContext to directly access backend API endpoints rather than scraping HTML.
This version represents a modern implementation targeting structured data sources
with minimal overhead and maximum efficiency.

Technical overview:
- Uses Playwright: A powerful browser automation library
- Uses APIRequestContext: Direct API access without browser rendering
- Single endpoint access: Retrieves data for one specific product
- JSON processing: Works with structured data instead of HTML
- Resource management: Properly initializes and disposes of contexts

Advantages of Playwright API approach:
- Bypasses frontend rendering completely
- Avoids complex HTML parsing and CSS selectors
- Receives data in structured JSON format
- Lower resource usage than full browser automation
- Avoids bot detection mechanisms tied to browser fingerprinting
- More stable than scraping dynamically rendered content
- Direct access to the same data sources used by the website

Limitations:
- Requires discovering and understanding API endpoints
- API structure may change without notice
- Single product focus lacks scalability
- No proxy implementation for IP rotation
- Potentially vulnerable to API rate limiting
- Requires manual inspection to discover API patterns

Target URL: https://www.adidas.com/plp-app/api/product/JI0861?sitePath=us
This endpoint provides comprehensive product information in JSON format,
demonstrating how to access backend APIs directly instead of scraping HTML.

    3. Processes and displays the complete product information

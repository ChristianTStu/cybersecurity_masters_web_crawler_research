# Web Crawler for API Reconnaissance & Anti-Bot Evasion

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of a **Masterâ€™s Report in Cybersecurity & Information Operations** from the **University of Arizona**. It aims to develop a **Python-based web crawler** that progressively increases in complexity, from **basic web scraping** to **bypassing advanced anti-bot protections**.

## Features

### Basic Crawler (Phase 1)
- Crawls and extracts static web content from simple pages
- Demonstrates fundamental HTTP request handling
- Stores structured data in JSON format
- Targets websites with minimal/no anti-bot protection

### Intermediate Crawler (Phase 2)
- Uses modern httpx and Selectolax libraries
- Implements enhanced header configurations to bypass basic protections
- Handles more complex HTML structures
- Demonstrates effective HTML parsing and data extraction
- Targets commercial websites with moderate anti-bot measures

### Advanced Crawler (Phase 3)
- Uses Playwright for API reconnaissance and direct backend access
- Implements proxy rotation for IP address anonymization
- Features selective field extraction and data transformation
- Bypasses sophisticated anti-bot measures
- Demonstrates enterprise-grade techniques for high-quality data extraction
- Targets websites with strong anti-bot protections

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChristianTStu/web_crawler_project.git
cd web_crawler_project
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. For the Advanced Crawler (Phase 3), you'll need to install browser dependencies for Playwright:
```bash
playwright install
```

5. Create a `.env` file from the example (for proxy support):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Usage

### Basic Crawler

```bash
# Run the urllib implementation
python -m crawlers.basic.urllib_crawler

# Run the requests implementation
python -m crawlers.basic.requests_crawler

# Run the Scrapy and BeautifulSoup implementation
python -m crawlers.basic.scrapy_bs_crawler
```

### Intermediate Crawler

```bash
# Run the basic httpx implementation
python -m crawlers.intermediate.httpx_basic

# Run the enhanced headers implementation
python -m crawlers.intermediate.httpx_enhanced

# Run the data extraction implementation
python -m crawlers.intermediate.httpx_extraction
```

### Advanced Crawler

```bash
# Run the single product API implementation
python -m crawlers.advanced.playwright_single

# Run the batch processing implementation
python -m crawlers.advanced.playwright_batch

# Run the proxy rotation implementation
python -m crawlers.advanced.playwright_proxy
```

## Ethical Considerations

This project is designed for educational purposes and legitimate cybersecurity research. Please use these tools responsibly:

- Always respect robots.txt directives
- Implement appropriate request delays to avoid overloading servers

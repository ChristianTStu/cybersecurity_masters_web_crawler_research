"""
Summary:
--------
This script scrapes product names and sale prices from the REI backpacking packs category page.
It uses the httpx library to send an HTTP GET request with detailed browser-mimicking headers,
and Selectolax to parse the returned HTML.

The script identifies individual product blocks using CSS selectors (located via Chrome DevTools),
extracts product names and sale prices, and cleans up the price strings by removing 
any additional discount or comparison text.

Note:
------
Due to REI's anti-bot protections, repeated or fast scraping may lead to temporary IP blocks.
Itâ€™s recommended to run this script cautiously with delays or consider upgrading to 
a headless browser solution like Playwright for more robust scraping.
